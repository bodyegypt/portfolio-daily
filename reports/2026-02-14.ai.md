## 1) US Stocks Market
Confidence: `Medium-High`

Macro regime (dated):
- Fed held policy at `3.50%-3.75%` on `January 28, 2026`, signaling data dependence.
- CPI (`January 2026`, released `February 13, 2026`): `+0.2% m/m`, `+2.4% y/y`.
- Labor (`January 2026`, released `February 11, 2026`): payrolls `+130k`, unemployment `4.3%`, wages `+3.7% y/y`.
- Curve snapshot: `3M 3.70%`, `10Y 4.09%`, `30Y 4.72%` (latest listed values), indicating a positively sloped curve.
- Broad USD index remains elevated at `118.24` (Feb 6 print), but below January highs (inference from recent series trajectory).

Sector rotation and concentration:
- S&P 500 closed at `6,836.17` (`February 13, 2026`) after failing to sustain recent highs.
- S&P sector concentration is still elevated in technology (~`33.4%` weight as of late January), while energy/materials leadership improved in early 2026 (cross-source inference).

Portfolio-specific options (not orders):
- `SGOL` + `SIVR` (together ~`61.9%` of US sleeve):
  - Option A: keep as macro hedge while defining a hard max sleeve weight.
  - Option B: rotate part of gains into lower-correlation USD cash/T-bills if real yields stay firm.
  - Tradeoff: hedge persistence vs concentration risk.
- `GOOG` (~`16.3%`):
  - Option A: hold as quality growth anchor if index breadth stabilizes.
  - Option B: reduce on failed rebounds if S&P stays below prior highs and dollar re-accelerates.
- `EOG` + `COP` (~`20.3%` combined):
  - Option A: keep as inflation/energy shock buffer.
  - Option B: trim if Brent loses trend and risk-on breadth broadens away from defensives.
- `URA` (small weight):
  - Option A: keep as optionality sleeve only.
  - Option B: cap size until momentum confirms above prior swing highs.

## 2) Crypto Market
Confidence: `Medium`

Liquidity and risk-on regime:
- BTC has shifted from Jan peak area into a high-volatility correction; latest prints cluster around upper-`60k` (multi-source).
- ETH around low-`2k` region (`$2,049.79` on Feb 13, Coinbase/FRED).
- Fund-flow tone: outflows slowed to `-$187m` week of `February 9, 2026`; BTC still net outflow `-$264m`, ETH small inflow `+$5.3m`.

Policy/regulation context:
- CFTC launched digital-asset collateral pilot (`December 8, 2025`) including `BTC`, `ETH`, `USDC`.
- U.S. market-structure bills remain active (`CLARITY Act` in Senate since `September 18, 2025`; `Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act` introduced `January 12, 2026`).
- Net: framework is evolving but not fully settled yet.

Portfolio-specific options (RENDER/HEDERA/ZILLIQA):
- Concentration first:
  - Option A: keep aggregate alt-beta exposure, but lower single-name caps.
  - Option B: rotate part of the largest loser exposure into BTC/ETH beta proxies to reduce idiosyncratic risk.
- `RENDER` (`44.74%` of crypto sleeve):
  - Option A: retain as high-beta leader only if BTC reclaims momentum zone.
  - Option B: reduce size if BTC loses local support again.
- `HEDERA` (`31.72%`) and `ZILLIQA` (`23.54%`):
  - Option A: maintain with strict invalidation levels.
  - Option B: rebalance toward lower-vol instruments if ETF/fund flows keep printing net outflows.

## 3) EGX Market
Confidence: `Medium-High`

Macro/FX/policy:
- CBE MPC cut policy rates by `100 bps` on `February 12, 2026` (deposit `19%`, lending `20%`, main `19.5%`) and lowered reserve requirement to `16%`.
- Inflation eased (`January 2026`): annual headline around `10.1%` nationwide, urban `11.9%`, core `11.2%`.
- USD/EGP around `46.85` (`February 13, 2026`), broadly stable-to-firm EGP vs prior stress zones.
- Suez traffic/revenue show partial recovery in early 2026, supporting external-liquidity narrative (inference from traffic/revenue updates).

Portfolio-specific options (AMOC/MPCI/MFPC/EGAL/JUFO/SAUD/IFAP):
- Concentration control:
  - `AMOC + MPCI` are ~`62.5%` of EGX sleeve.
  - Option A: keep exposure while rates are easing, but set maximum combined cap.
  - Option B: rebalance gradually into smaller holdings on strength to reduce single-theme risk.
- `MPCI` (only meaningful detractor):
  - Option A: hold if EGX index structure remains above support cluster.
  - Option B: reduce if index breaks support and USD/EGP re-weakens.
- `EGAL/JUFO/SAUD` (large embedded gains):
  - Option A: hold with trailing risk bands.
  - Option B: partial de-risk into cash buffer on upside spikes.

## 4) Alternatives and Hedge Mapping
Confidence: `Medium`

- Gold/silver sleeve is already the core hedge (`SGOL`, `SIVR`) against growth-equity and EM risk shocks.
- Energy exposure (`EOG`, `COP`) hedges part of inflation/geopolitical supply-shock risk.
- Short-duration fixed income/cash:
  - With front-end yields near `3.7%`, cash-like instruments can provide carry while reducing drawdown pressure.
- Hedge gaps (inference):
  - Crypto sleeve has no explicit volatility hedge.
  - EGX sleeve has high domestic concentration and FX-policy sensitivity.

## 5) Technical-Analysis Move Plan
Confidence: `Medium` (levels are tactical, not predictive)

Multi-timeframe structure:
- `S&P 500` (close `6,836.17` on Feb 13): medium-term uptrend, short-term consolidation.
  - Resistance: `6,900` then `7,000`.
  - Support: `6,700` then `6,500`.
- `BTC` (spot cluster around `68k` on Feb 14): medium-term correction after sharp drawdown.
  - Resistance: `70,500` then `73,000`.
  - Support: `66,000`, then `62,000` / `60,000`.
- `ETH` (`2,049.79` on Feb 13): weak recovery from washout zone.
  - Resistance: `2,150` then `2,300`.
  - Support: `1,960` then `1,820`.
- `EGX30` (`50,490` close Feb 12): trend positive, near recent highs.
  - Resistance: `50,930` then `51,600`.
  - Support: `49,400` then `48,800`.

Triggered move map:
- If breakout:
  - Keep winning hedges but shift some capital from defensive concentration toward diversified beta.
  - In crypto, prioritize quality-beta exposure over thin-liquidity tails.
- If breakdown:
  - Prioritize drawdown control: reduce highest concentration buckets first (crypto alts, top EGX pair).
  - Increase cash/short-duration buffer.
- If range:
  - Use rebalance bands: trim near resistance, re-add selectively near support.
  - Keep position sizes under concentration caps.

3. Bear case (`25%`, confidence `Medium`)
- Triggers:
  - Renewed geopolitical escalation lifts oil and real yields.
  - Crypto risk-off resumes with persistent outflows.
  - USD re-strengthens and EM risk premium rises.
- Portfolio implication options:

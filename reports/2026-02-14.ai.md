# AI Decision Report - 2026-02-14

Ground truth read from:
- `reports/2026-02-14.md`
- `reports/2026-02-14.json`

Decision timestamp:
- Portfolio anchor date: `2026-02-14`
- Macro/market source window: through `2026-02-14`

Method:
- I use your factual wallet data as truth.
- I overlay latest dated macro/policy/market context.
- I provide direct actions (`BUY/HOLD/SELL/TRIM`) with sizing and invalidation.

## Wallet 1: Thndr US / Sheet1 (US Equities)

Factual anchor:
- Wallet value: `$866.72`
- P&L: `+$297.03` (`+52.14%`)
- Top-3 concentration: `78.18%`
- Biggest concentration: `SGOL` + `SIVR` = `61.86%`

### My highest-likelihood view
Next 24h (`55%`): **range/chop with defensive bias**
- Why: Fed is on hold (`3.50%-3.75%` on Jan 28), inflation cooled (`2.4% y/y` CPI Jan), labor is still firm (`130k` payroll, `4.3%` unemployment), and S&P closed below recent highs (`6,836.17`).

Next 2 weeks (`50%`): **sideways-to-slightly-up, but concentration risk is your main threat**
- Why: macro is not recessionary now, but breadth/volatility risk remains if yields reprice up.

### Direct action plan (current holdings)
| Symbol | Action now | Size change | Approx notional | Trigger / condition | Invalidation / stop | If right | If wrong |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|---|---|---|
| SGOL | TRIM | -8.0% wallet | -$69.34 | Execute now to reduce top-2 concentration | If gold closes strong for 2 sessions while S&P < 6700, pause further trims | Lower concentration drag, keep hedge core | Miss part of upside if metals squeeze |
| SIVR | TRIM | -5.0% wallet | -$43.34 | Execute now alongside SGOL trim | If silver momentum expands for 2 sessions, hold residual | Frees risk budget for diversified adds | Underexposed if metals rally continues |
| GOOG | BUY | +4.0% wallet | +$34.67 | Add on intraday weakness / non-breakout entries | Daily close below recent support and failed reclaim | Better growth participation with controlled size | Adds beta into pullback |
| EOG | HOLD | 0.0% | $0.00 | Keep as inflation/geopolitical hedge sleeve | Two closes below trend support in oil-linked complex | Keeps diversification vs pure tech/metals mix | Opportunity cost if energy lags |
| COP | BUY | +3.0% wallet | +$26.00 | Add only if no broad risk-off break in S&P < 6700 | S&P breakdown plus oil weakness | Improves cyclical hedge balance | Adds cyclicality into drawdown |
| URA | HOLD | 0.0% | $0.00 | Keep small as optionality | If volatility spike + failed reclaim, do not add | Preserves upside optionality | Small position may stay insignificant |

Net immediate effect:
- Gross trims: `13%` (`$112.68`)
- Gross buys: `7%` (`$60.67`)
- Raise USD cash buffer: `~6%` (`$52.01`)

Top 3 prioritized action items (expected value rank):
1. Trim `SGOL/SIVR` concentration now.
2. Add `GOOG` in controlled size (not on breakout chase).
3. Build small cash buffer from trim proceeds.

Alternatives for this wallet:
- Keep a short-duration USD cash sleeve at `8%-12%`.
- Do not let top-2 holdings exceed `55%` after rebalance.

## Wallet 2: Thndr US / Crypto

Factual anchor:
- Wallet value: `$2,118.74`
- P&L: `-$3,401.36` (`-61.62%`)
- Top-3 concentration: `100%`
- Positions: `RENDER 44.48%`, `HEDERA 31.77%`, `ZILLIQA 23.75%`
- Accounting adjustment: `OLD LOSS $1,570`

### My highest-likelihood view
Next 24h (`50%`): **high-volatility range, not clean trend**
- Why: outflows slowed (`-$187m` week of Feb 9), but BTC still had outflows (`-$264m`), so sentiment is stabilizing, not fully risk-on.

Next 2 weeks (`45%`): **base case = range then selective recovery, with downside tail if BTC loses support**
- Why: flow deceleration is constructive, policy backdrop is improving, but positioning is still fragile.

### Direct action plan (current holdings)
| Symbol | Action now | Size change | Approx notional | Trigger / condition | Invalidation / stop | If right | If wrong |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|---|---|---|
| RENDER | TRIM | -6.0% wallet | -$127.12 | Execute now for deconcentration | If BTC reclaims and holds > 70,500 for 2 closes, pause further trim | Reduces single-name shock risk | Reduced upside if alt-beta snaps up |
| HEDERA | HOLD | 0.0% | $0.00 | Keep as core residual | If BTC closes < 66,000, reduce by 4% wallet | Keeps participation without adding risk | Drawdown persists if market weakens |
| ZILLIQA | SELL | -8.0% wallet | -$169.50 | Execute now (weakest pnl profile) | If momentum regime clearly flips risk-on, reassess | Cuts tail-risk concentration | Surrenders rebound if sharp alt rally |

### New buys (to improve quality/liquidity mix)
- `BUY BTC` +`8%` wallet (`~$169.50`) only if BTC holds above `68,500` after intraday retest.
- `BUY ETH` +`5%` wallet (`~$105.94`) only if ETH holds above `2,050`.

Net immediate effect:
- Gross sells/trims: `14%` (`$296.62`)
- Planned buys (conditional): `13%` (`$275.44`)
- Residual cash/stable reserve target: `~3%` (`$63.56`)

Hard risk rules (crypto wallet):
- If BTC daily close `< 66,000`: reduce another `10%-12%` wallet risk.
- If BTC daily close `> 70,500` and ETH `> 2,150` for 2 sessions: allow only gradual re-risking.
- Single-token cap after rebalance: `<= 40%`.

Top 3 prioritized action items:
1. Cut `ZILLIQA` size now.
2. Trim `RENDER` now to lower top-1 concentration.
3. Rotate part of risk into BTC/ETH only on confirmation.

Alternatives for this wallet:
- Keep dedicated stable-cash sleeve for volatility shocks.
- Favor liquidity quality over narrative beta until flows turn net positive.

## Wallet 3: Thndr Egx / Sheet1 (EGX)

Factual anchor:
- Wallet value: `EGP 28,814.85`
- P&L: `EGP +5,289.69` (`+22.49%`)
- Top-3 concentration: `81.58%`
- Top weights: `AMOC 34.40%`, `MPCI 28.13%`, `MFPC 19.06%`

### My highest-likelihood view
Next 24h (`60%`): **controlled upside with pullbacks**
- Why: CBE cut rates by `100 bps` on Feb 12, inflation keeps easing (headline `10.1%`, urban `11.9%`, core `11.2%`), and EGX30 closed strong (`50,490.20`).

Next 2 weeks (`55%`): **positive drift, but concentration is the dominant portfolio risk**
- Why: easing cycle supports equities, but top-2 concentration leaves the wallet vulnerable to single-name reversals.

### Direct action plan (current holdings)
| Symbol | Action now | Size change | Approx notional | Trigger / condition | Invalidation / stop | If right | If wrong |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|---|---|---|
| AMOC | TRIM | -6.0% wallet | -EGP 1,728.89 | Execute now to deconcentrate | If EGX30 breaks out > 50,930 with breadth, slow further trims | Locks gains, lowers top-2 risk | Leaves upside on table |
| MPCI | TRIM | -5.0% wallet | -EGP 1,440.74 | Execute now (largest risk contributor with weak pnl) | If relative strength recovers and index trend holds, stop trimming | Reduces drawdown sensitivity | Potential whipsaw if rebound starts |
| MFPC | BUY | +3.0% wallet | +EGP 864.45 | Add on stable tape while EGX30 > 49,400 | If EGX30 loses 49,400 and fails reclaim | Broadens exposure away from top-2 | Adds risk into breakdown |
| EGAL | BUY | +3.0% wallet | +EGP 864.45 | Add gradually in strong market breadth | If price action fails with market breadth deterioration | Keeps winner exposure with controlled sizing | Chasing risk if momentum fades |
| JUFO | HOLD | 0.0% | EGP 0.00 | Keep; avoid overtrading small sleeve | If liquidity deteriorates sharply, reduce | Preserves upside optionality | Illiquidity/volatility risk |
| SAUD | HOLD | 0.0% | EGP 0.00 | Keep due smaller weight | If abnormal volatility/event risk, reduce | Maintains exposure without concentration add | Non-core performance drag |
| IFAP | BUY | +1.0% wallet | +EGP 288.15 | Small add only after confirming liquidity | If slippage/high spread persists, cancel add | Diversifies away from top-2 | Liquidity risk dominates return |

Net immediate effect:
- Gross trims: `11%` (`EGP 3,169.63`)
- Gross buys: `7%` (`EGP 2,017.04`)
- Raise EGP liquidity reserve: `~4%` (`EGP 1,152.59`)

Top 3 prioritized action items:
1. Trim `AMOC` and `MPCI` immediately.
2. Reallocate selectively to `MFPC` and `EGAL`.
3. Keep a dedicated EGP reserve while concentration normalizes.

Alternatives for this wallet:
- Maintain EGP short-duration liquidity sleeve.
- Enforce top-2 cap target `<= 58%` after rebalance.

## Cross-wallet allocation plan (practical)

Approx risk-budget conversion using `USD/EGP 46.85`:
- Current (approx):
  - US Equities: `24.1%`
  - US Crypto: `58.8%`
  - EGX: `17.1%`

Target allocation (most likely to improve risk-adjusted profile):
- US Equities: `35%` (delta `+10.9%`)
- US Crypto: `40%` (delta `-18.8%`)
- EGX: `25%` (delta `+7.9%`)

Why this is my preferred mix:
- You reduce dependence on one high-volatility engine (crypto).
- You keep upside participation in all 3 sleeves.
- You lower portfolio fragility from concentration clustering.

## Scenario matrix (what to do)

1. Bull (`30%`)
- Triggers: `SP500 > 6,900`, `BTC > 70,500`, `EGX30 > 50,930`.
- Action: keep core longs, slow trimming, re-risk gradually from cash.

2. Base (`45%`) **Highest likelihood**
- Triggers: mixed/range behavior around current levels.
- Action: execute deconcentration now, buy only on confirmation/pullback, keep liquidity sleeves.

3. Bear (`25%`)
- Triggers: `SP500 < 6,700`, `BTC < 66,000`, `EGX30 < 49,400`.
- Action: cut high-beta first (crypto + most concentrated names), raise cash faster.
